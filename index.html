      Hey! My name is Justin. I'm a technology professional with 6 years of work experience and over 
      20 years of self-study and passion. I currently reside in Traverse City and would love to make it my permanent home 
    </p>
    <p>
      As a young teen I was tinkering with a hand-me-down computer and learning the ins and outs of DOS, Windows 3.1, and hand typing code from a book into a QBASIC editor. Fast forward a few years and I was doing static HTML on a GeoCities site.
    </p>
    <p>
      What really ignited my passion was the original Xbox and the moding community that surrounded it. By early 2000's I had a home network setup with a file server for all my "Linux ISO's" and was streaming them all around my network.
    </p>
    <p> 
      As time went on, my homelab grew and the technologies that I employed expanded to include virtualization and advanced networking.
