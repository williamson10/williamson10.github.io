title: About me
---
I have always been drawn to computers. As a teen in the 90's, computers were the future and I was hand typing QBASIC code from a book to see if it would run. This was fun for me and I still have that curiosity and dry sense of a good time. In my travels I have dabbled in a lot of things. I've played with [PowerShell](https://github.com/williamson10/PowerShell), [Python](https://github.com/williamson10/pyGridWars), [git](https://github.com/williamson10), [Jekyll](/), and others. I want this site and OpenLAB to be the culmination of all that experimentation. 

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
